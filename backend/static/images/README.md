# Static Images Directory

Place static image files used in your Django project here. These are different from media files (user uploads) and include:

- Logo images
- UI icons
- Background images
- Default avatars
- Other non-user-generated images

Images placed here will be collected into the staticfiles directory when running `python manage.py collectstatic`.
